jKeyring: The Netbeans&trade; keyring, without Netbeans
=============

jKeyring is an abstraction for secure storage of credential information that is implemented on top of Windows DPAPI, MacOS X Keyring, KDE KWallet or GNOME Keyring, with a default implementation when none of the underlying native keyrings are available. It was originally written as part of Netbeans. We excised the core functionality from Netbeans and created this independent library as part of the jOVAL&trade; project.
